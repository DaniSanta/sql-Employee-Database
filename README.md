![sql.png](sql.png)

## Background

In this assignment, I will design the tables to hold data in the CSVs, import the CSVs into a SQL database, and answer questions about the data. In other words, I will perform:

1. Data Modeling

2. Data Engineering

3. Data Analysis

## Instructions

#### Data Modeling

I will inspect the CSVs and sketch out an ERD of the tables. Using a tool like [http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com](http://www.quickdatabasediagrams.com).

#### Data Engineering

* Using the information I have to create a table schema for each of the six CSV files. Specifing data types, primary keys, foreign keys, and other constraints.

* Importing each CSV file into the corresponding SQL table.

#### Data Analysis

Once I had the complete database, I did the following:

1. Listed the following details of each employee: employee number, last name, first name, gender, and salary.

2. Listed employees who were hired in 1986.

3. Listed the manager of each department with the following information: department number, department name, the manager's employee number, last name, first name, and start and end employment dates.

4. Listed the department of each employee with the following information: employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

5. Listed all employees whose first name is "Hercules" and last names begin with "B."

6. Listed all employees in the Sales department, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

7. Listed all employees in the Sales and Development departments, including their employee number, last name, first name, and department name.

8. In descending order, list the frequency count of employee last names, i.e., how many employees share each last name.
